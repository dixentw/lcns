## 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

>Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

>â€‹	Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

1. the difference between #1 and #2 is that we can keep at most two dups in array.
2. the algorithm is basically the same wtih #1, with little tweak by adding cnt variable.

```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i-1]) {
                start++;
                cnt = 0;
            } else {
                cnt++;
                if(cnt<2){
                    start++;
                }
            }
            nums[start] = nums[i];
        }
        return start+1;
    }
```
3. better, we just need to check previous two element is the same.
4. how to setup the boundary at this method? start loop from 2?
5. setting up the init from 2 is ok, but the point is compare with previous element with `idx-2` not `i-2` because when `i` larger than `idx`,  this `-2` comparison will broke.

```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int idx = 2;
        for (int i=2; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[idx-2] != nums[i]) {
                nums[idx++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return idx;
    }
```

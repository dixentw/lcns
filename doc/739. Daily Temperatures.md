## 739. Daily Temperatures

Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

**Note:** The length of `temperatures` will be in the range `[1, 30000]`. Each temperature will be an integer in the range `[30, 100]`.

1. naive solution would be check every element and find the next larger element in array. O(N^2)
2. this is almost like monotonic array algorithm, but didn't come out with how to use it.
3. [SOLUTION] the key point would be store the index in array. If we hit the larger element, we update the index with latest diff between current index and stored index.
4. here we use stack

```java
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        Stack<Integer> mono = new Stack<>();
        int[] res = new int[T.length];
        for (int i=0; i<T.length; i++) {
            while (!mono.isEmpty() && T[i] > T[mono.peek()]) {
                int s = mono.pop();
                res[s] = i - s;
            }
            mono.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

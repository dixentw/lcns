## 158. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times

Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read *n* characters. **Your method read may be called multiple times.**

 

**Method read4:** 

The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

```
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
```

Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:

```
File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file
```

 

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method `read` that reads *n* characters from the file and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:** 

```
    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]
```

 

**Example 1:**

```
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
// Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
```

 

---

1. the difference between 157 and 158 is that 158 should save the state of read. for the next call, readBuf will be reset, so we need to fill the buffer until we reach previous position.
2. the hard point is :
   1. keep previous absolute position, when read counter didn't reach this position, don't write to output buffer.
   2. but when write to output buffer, we need offset to make writing to relative position.
3. to make it simpler, maintain a remaining variable. if previously read buffer didn't consumed, use it.

```java
public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    int offset = 0;
    int remain = 0;
    boolean eof = false;
    char[] readBuf = new char[4];

    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int start = 0;
        while (n > start && (!eof ||remain!=0)) {
            int currRead = 0;
            if (remain != 0) { // use previously read buffer
                currRead = remain;
            } else { // read new buffer
                offset = 0;
                currRead = read4(readBuf);
                if (currRead < 4) eof = true;
            }
            // fill the output buffer
            int actualReadCnt = Math.min(currRead, n-start);
            for (int i=offset; i<offset+actualReadCnt; i++) {
                buf[start++] = readBuf[i];    
            }
            remain = currRead - actualReadCnt;
            if (remain != 0) offset += actualReadCnt;
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```

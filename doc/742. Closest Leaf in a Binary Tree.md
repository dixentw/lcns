## 742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree **where every node has a unique value**, and a target key `k`, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target `k` in the tree.

Here, *nearest* to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a *leaf* if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual `root` tree given will be a TreeNode object.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output: 2 (or 3)

Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
```

---

1. this is not the binary search tree.
2. find the k node first.
3. recursion can have path, once we hit the k, then start to accumulate path, then find the mininum path.
4. 3 is not true, the leaf can be other tree, that is passing through target node's parent.
5. calculate every leaves, must can find the shortest path to target node.

[SOLUTION]

1. find the target node
2. BFS search leaf, notice that when backing to other subtree, need to maintain a visited set, so that for upper node, their child can be omit.

```java
    public int findClosestLeaf(TreeNode root, int k) {
        Map<TreeNode, TreeNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<TreeNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
        TreeNode knode = find(root,k, map);
        q.offer(knode);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = q.poll();
            if (curr.left == null && curr.right == null) return curr.val;
            if (curr.left != null && visited.add(curr.left)) {
                q.offer(curr.left);
            }
            if (curr.right != null && .add(curr.right)) {
                q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            if (map.containsKey(curr) && visited.add(map.get(curr))) {
                q.offer(map.get(curr));
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public TreeNode find(TreeNode root, int k, Map<TreeNode, TreeNode> map) {
        if (root.val == k) return root;
        if (root.left != null) {
            map.put(root.left, root);
            TreeNode left = find(root.left, k, map);
            if (left != null) return left;
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            map.put(root.right, root);
            TreeNode right = find(root.right, k, map);
            if (right != null) return right;
        }
        return null;
    }
```

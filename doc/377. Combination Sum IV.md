## 377. Combination Sum IV

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

**Example:**

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
```

 

**Follow up:**
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

---

1. very similar with coin change problem
2. we want all combination, not the smallest one. the optimization function here change to the all method count that can form target.

```java
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] f = new int[target+1];
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<f.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<nums.length;j++){
                if (i>=nums[j]) {
                    f[i] += f[i-nums[j]];
                }
            }
        }
        return f[target];
    }
```

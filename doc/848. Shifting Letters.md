## 848. Shifting Letters

We have a string S of lowercase letters, and an integer array shifts.
Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). 
For example, shift('a') = 'b', shift('t') = 'u', and shift('z') = 'a'.
Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i+1 letters of S, x times.
Return the final string after all such shifts to S are applied.

>Example 1:
Input: S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: 
We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.

----

1. easy logic, for each shifts, from 0 to i, add charcters's value
1. remember to wrap z to a.
1. not easy as first look, the shift takes so many times. need mod
1. should pre-calculate desired change instead of two loops, or will hit TLE

[FAIL] : wrong calculate about wrap  `'a' + origin + c - 'z' - 1` origin no minus one `'a' + origin + c - 'z'`

```java
    public String shiftingLetters(String S, int[] shifts) {
        char[] cs = S.toCharArray();
        // calculate from back, easier to accumulate
        for (int i=shifts.length-2; i>=0; i--) {
            shifts[i] = (shifts[i] + shifts[i+1]) % 26;
        }
        for (int i=0; i<shifts.length; i++) {
            int originIdx = cs[i] - 'a';
            int shiftIdx = (originIdx + shifts[i]) % 26;
            cs[i] = (char)(shiftIdx + 'a');
        }
        return new String(cs);
    }

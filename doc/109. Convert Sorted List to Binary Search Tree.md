## 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

1. can translate it to array, but it kind of lost the point of this question.

2. [SOLUTION] don't need to find all elements for SBT, just find middle element for root in each recursion, that is enough.

3. [FAIL] should break the link of middle point.

4. the runing time would be *N*/2+2∗*N*/4+4∗*N*/8+8∗*N*/16....

   > logN * (2^(i-1) * N/(2^i)) = *N*/2*l**o**g**N*

```java
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (prev == null) {
            return new TreeNode(slow.val);
        }
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(prev.next.val);
        prev.next = null;
        root.left = sortedListToBST(head);
        root.right = sortedListToBST(slow.next);
        return root;
    }
```

### second

* if we traverse BST with in-order manner, we got a sorted list. This fact inspire the following method: we still find middle, but just to execute the recursive call, to construct the valid recursive calls.
* In this calls, the in-order traversal will consume the list with O(N) time to construct the tree.
* This method is more like reverse the in order traversal plus to calculate mid everytime to make sure the height is correctly with logN.

```java
    ListNode curr;
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        int counter = 0;
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            counter++;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        curr = head;
        return helper(0, counter-1);
    }
    public TreeNode helper(int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) return null;
        int mid = (start+end)/2;
        TreeNode left = helper(start, mid-1); // in order traversal left sub tree
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(curr.val); // the node here must be exactly same order in ordered list.
        curr = curr.next;
        TreeNode right = helper(mid+1, end); // in order traversal right sub tree
        root.left =left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }
```

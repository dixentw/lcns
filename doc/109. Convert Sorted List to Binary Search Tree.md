## 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

1. can translate it to array, but it kind of lost the point of this question.
2. [SOLUTION] don't need to find all elements for SBT, just find middle element for root in each recursion, that is enough.
3. [FAIL] should break the link.

```java
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (prev == null) {
            return new TreeNode(slow.val);
        }
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(prev.next.val);
        prev.next = null;
        root.left = sortedListToBST(head);
        root.right = sortedListToBST(slow.next);
        return root;
    }
```

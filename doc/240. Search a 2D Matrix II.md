## 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example:**

Consider the following matrix:

```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```

Given target = `5`, return `true`.

Given target = `20`, return `false`.

1. the difference is this time, the second row is not strictly larger then previous row.
2. naive : O(N^2)
3. do binary search against row, do binary search against column. when find the row and column, that possibly have target number, binary search against that row and column.
4. target still possibly locate in smaller area...
5. after got the possbile col `c1` and row `r1`, I got the largest possible row and col, then I can ignore all row and col that smaller then target.
6. [SOLUTION] not necessarily need to do binary search. just eliminate the impossible row and columns. O(M+N)
   1. locate largest row and smallest col, if `M[R][C]< target` then Col need plus 1. else Row minus 1.(target cannot be in current row)
   2. better explaination [ref](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/discuss/299379/JAVA%3A-Multiple-approaches-Simple-and-Concise)

```java
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int col = 0;
        int row = matrix.length-1;
        while (row > 0 && col < matrix[0].length) {
            if (matrix[row][col]==target) return true;
            if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
                row--;
            } else {
                col++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

### more easy to think about this problem : binary search O(MlogN)

```java
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        for (int i=0; i<matrix.length; i++) {
            boolean exist = search(matrix[i], target);
            if (exist) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    public boolean search (int[] row, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = row.length-1;
        while (start<=end) {
            int mid = (start+end)/2;
            if (row[mid]==target) {
                return true;
            } else if (row[mid]>target) {
                end = mid-1;
            } else {
                start = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

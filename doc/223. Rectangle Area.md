## 223. Rectangle Area

Find the total area covered by two **rectilinear** rectangles in a **2D** plane.
Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Example:
```
Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45
Note:
```
Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int

----
1. sum two recs area and minus overlap
2. if they are overlap - C>E && A<G && B<G && F<D 
3. calculate overlap four point is better way to judge if there is a overlap

```java
    public int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        int s1 = (C-A) * (D-B);
        int s2 = (G-E) * (H-F);
        int left = Math.max(A, E);
        int right = Math.min(G, C);
        int bottom = Math.max(B, F);
        int top = Math.min(D, H);
        if (right > left && top  > bottom) { //overlap
            return s1 + s2 - ((right-left) * (top-bottom));
        } else {
            return s1 + s2;
        }
    }
```

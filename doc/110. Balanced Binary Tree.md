## 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

>Example 1:
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.

>Example 2:
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
Return false.

1. compare two child's level, but how to make it in one function call?
2. keep the longest level of each child. the result is longest left and right path difference is <=1

[FAIL] at
      1
      / \
     2   2
    /     \
   3       3
  /         \
 4                       4
 
 every level should check the child
 
 ```java
     public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return true;
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
     	//[FAIL] `&& isBalanced(root.left) && isBalanced(root.right);` is mandatory, only Math.abs(left-right)<=1 is not enough
        return Math.abs(left-right) <= 1 && isBalanced(root.left) && isBalanced(root.right);

    }
    public int helper(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int maxLv = Math.max(helper(node.left), helper(node.right));
        return maxLv+1;
    }
```

## 682. Baseball Game

You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

1. `Integer` (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
2. `"+"` (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two `valid` round's points.
3. `"D"` (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last `valid` round's points.
4. `"C"` (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last `valid` round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.



Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
```

1. use a stack to trace the whole scores, return all sum in stack at final.
2. how to handle stack is empty? - assume that input is valid for stack operation
3. [FAIL] to handle negative number in regular expression.

```java
    public int calPoints(String[] ops) {
        Stack<Integer> scores = new Stack<>();
        for (String op : ops) {
            if (op.matches("[\\+\\-]?[0-9]+")) {
                scores.push(Integer.parseInt(op));
            } else if (op.equals("C")) {
                scores.pop();
            } else if (op.equals("D")) {
                scores.push(2*scores.peek());
            } else if (op.equals("+")) {
                int a  = scores.pop();
                int b  = scores.pop();
                scores.push(b);
                scores.push(a);
                scores.push(a+b);
            }
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (Integer i : scores) {
            System.out.println(i);
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```

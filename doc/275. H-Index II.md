## 275. H-Index II

Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

1. this is problem that asking: given an ascending order array, find a element that, the other value of elements are at least that value, and another values are less.
2. we can use binary search to find that specific value, but what is the termination condition?
   1. at least `h` paper means `length-mid`, should `equal or less then nums[mid]`
   2. if len-mid > nums[mid], then find larger nums[mid], start = mid+1
   3. else end = mid-1 (alought it valid, but find the closer one)
3. how to deal with duplications?



```java
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.length;
        int start = 0;
        int end = len-1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            if (len-mid == citations[mid]) {
                return len-mid;
            } else if (len-mid > citations[mid]){
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return len-start;
    }
```

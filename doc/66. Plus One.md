## 66. Plus One

* most complex thing is to decide should add one more digit?
* since the only number could go to new digit by add one is 99999....
* which means that we just pass the new array with leading 1,0,0,0,0....
* no carry way : if the digit is smaller than 9, plus one and return
* if 9, make this digit = 0, and move on.

```java
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        for (int i=digits.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
            if (digits[i] < 9) {
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            digits[i] = 0;
        }
        int[] newInts = new int[digits.length+1];
        newInts[0] = 1;
        return newInts;
    }
```

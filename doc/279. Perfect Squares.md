## 279. Perfect Squares

Given a positive integer *n*, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, `1, 4, 9, 16, ...`) which sum to *n*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

1. is every N can find that those number to sum? - there are plenty of `1`, so it should
2. suppose it can. then backtracking with perfect squre set? tooooo slow, and we need the smallest number to make it.
3. didn't occurs to me that this is a dynamic programming problem.
4. `DP[N] = min(DP[N-1*1]+1, DP[N-2*2]+1, DP[N-3*3]+1....)`, -> remove `1*1 or 2*2...` and to see which combination is smallest.

original version: will failed at given `1`
```java
    public int numSquares(int n) {
        int[] DP = new int[n+1];
        DP[0] = 0;
        DP[1] = 1;
        DP[2] = 2;
        DP[3] = 3;
        for (int i=4; i<=n; i++) {
            int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j=1; i-j*j>=0; j++) {
                min = Math.min(min, DP[i-j*j]+1);
            }
            DP[i]  = min;
        }
        return DP[n];
    }
```

better version:
```java
    public int numSquares(int n) {
        int[] DP = new int[n+1];
        DP[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j=1; i-j*j>=0; j++) {
                min = Math.min(min, DP[i-j*j]+1);
            }
            DP[i]  = min;
        }
        return DP[n];
    }
```

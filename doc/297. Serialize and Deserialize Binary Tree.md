## 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

>Example: 
You may serialize the following tree:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 â€‹    / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"

----
1. it seems like using BFS algorithm for serialization and deserializaiton.
2. Serialization
   1. how do I know the current level, if not sufficient, who is null?
   2. no matter what, push null to child. but. will face how to terminate the loop issue.
3. Deserialization
   1. didn't come out of the while loop when apply BFS
   2. maybe just init List of tree, then connect them would be more convienient.
   3. just using recursive, could be much easier

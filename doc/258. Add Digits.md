## 258. Add Digits

Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

**Example:**

```
Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

**Follow up:**
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

1. naive is almost O(n^2)

2. O(1) will be the formula

   ```

```java
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
        return num % 9;
    }
```

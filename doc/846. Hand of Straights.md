## 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has a `hand` of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Return `true` if and only if she can.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
```

----

1. first I can use mod to determinate there is valid grouping.
2. how to group each card so that I can see there is consecutive order?
   1. sort the array.
   2. scan for a group, if there is duplicate, use duplicate once.

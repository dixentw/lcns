## 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has a `hand` of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Return `true` if and only if she can.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
```

1. first I can use mod to determinate there is valid grouping.
2. how to group each card so that I can see there is consecutive order?
   1. sort the array.
   2. scan for a group, if there is duplicate, use duplicate once.
   3. for that reason, I try to use map, should using treeMap to get the order list, we can ommit step1 sort.
   4. the base index should be all removed ex: `[1,1,2,2,3,3]`, for counting 2, the freq of 2 should remove by 2, not one, because there are two `1`s

```java
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int W) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int n : hand) map.put(n, map.getOrDefault(n, 0)+1);
        
        for (int k : map.keySet()) {
            int freq = map.get(k);
            if (freq > 0) {
                for (int i=k; i<k+W; i++) {
                    if (map.getOrDefault(i, 0) <= 0) return false;
                    map.put(i, map.get(i)-freq);
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

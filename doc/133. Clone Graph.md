## 133. Clone Graph

Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` (`int`) and a list (`List[UndirectedGraphNode]`) of its `neighbors`. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use

 

```
#
```

 

as a separator for each node, and

 

```
,
```

 

as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

 

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

 

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

----

1. BFS or DFS traverse to build the connection. 
2. the problem will become how to add copy code to BFS traversal?
   1. the first test case {0,0,0} get wrong because this case only need to add edge, not node it self.
   2. this induce the most tricky part of this problem, that we need to keep a map of copied node.

[FAIL]

```java
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        if (node == null) return node;
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> qc= new LinkedList<>();
        Set<UndirectedGraphNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
        UndirectedGraphNode root = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
        q.offer(node);
        qc.offer(root);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode curr = q.poll();
            UndirectedGraphNode currDup = qc.poll();
            for (UndirectedGraphNode n : curr.neighbors) {
                if (!visited.contains(n)) {
                    if (n.label == curr.label) { // wrong at case ...#3,4,4#..., the duplicated edges not always happend to current node.
                        currDup.neighbors.add(currDup);                        
                    } else {
                        currDup.neighbors.add(new UndirectedGraphNode(n.label));
                        q.offer(n);
                    }
                }
            }
            visited.add(curr);
            for (UndirectedGraphNode n : currDup.neighbors) qc.offer(n);
        }
        return root;
    }
```



[SOLUTION] - use map to store created node, since we have created node, we can contruct edges by operating on map. so we can eliminate another queue for copied graph.

```java
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        if (node == null) return node;
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Map<Integer, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        UndirectedGraphNode root = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
        q.offer(node);
        map.put(root.label, root);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode curr = q.poll();
            for (UndirectedGraphNode n : curr.neighbors) {
                if (!map.containsKey(n.label)) {
                    map.put(n.label, new UndirectedGraphNode(n.label));
                    q.offer(n);
                }
                map.get(curr.label).neighbors.add(map.get(n.label));
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
```

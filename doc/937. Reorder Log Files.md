## 937. Reorder Log Files

You have an array of `logs`.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric *identifier*.  Then, either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

We will call these two varieties of logs *letter-logs* and *digit-logs*.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
```

1. check the log is digit log or character log
2. how to sort character log? treemap?

[SOLUTION] -

1. use custom sort
2. reuse string compare is the key

```java
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        Arrays.sort(logs, (a, b)->{
            int l1idx = a.indexOf(' ');
            int l2idx = b.indexOf(' ');
            
            String log1 = a.substring(l1idx+1);
            String log2 = b.substring(l2idx+1);
            
            boolean isLog1Digit = Character.isDigit(log1.charAt(0));
            boolean isLog2Digit = Character.isDigit(log2.charAt(0));
            
            if (isLog1Digit && isLog2Digit) {
                return 0;
            } else if (isLog1Digit) {
                return 1;
            } else if (isLog2Digit) {
                return -1;
            } else {
                int cmp = log1.compareTo(log2);
                if (cmp==0) return a.substring(0,l1idx+1).compareTo(b.substring(0, l2idx+1));
                else return cmp;
            }
        });
        return logs;
    }
```

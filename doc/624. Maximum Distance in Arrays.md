## 624. Maximum Distance in Arrays

Given m arrays, and each array is sorted in ascending order. Now you can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a-b|. Your task is to find the maximum distance.

>Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,2,3],
 [4,5],
 [1,2,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.

----

1. reference to word distance #243, but more arrays to compare, and want max distance, not minimum
2. all arrays are sorted, which means we only compare the last, and first element of all array, the answer is their diff

[FAIL]

1. init with smallest value with 0 (could be wrong if every first element is larger then 0)
2. cannot handle the largest and smallest element coming from the same array

```java
    public int maxDistance(List<List<Integer>> arrays) {
        int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (List<Integer> arr : arrays) {
            smallest = Math.min(smallest, arr.get(0));
            largest = Math.max(largest, arr.get(arr.size()-1));
        }
        return largest - smallest;
    }
```

update result with every loop

AC solution

```java
    public int maxDistance(List<List<Integer>> arrays) {
        int smallest = arrays.get(0).get(0);
        int largest = arrays.get(0).get(arrays.get(0).size()-1);
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int i=0;
        for (List<Integer> arr : arrays) {
            if (i > 0) { // anyway, find a way to skip the first loop
                res = Math.max(res, largest - arr.get(0));
                res = Math.max(res, arr.get(arr.size()-1) - smallest);
                smallest = Math.min(smallest, arr.get(0));
                largest = Math.max(largest, arr.get(arr.size()-1));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

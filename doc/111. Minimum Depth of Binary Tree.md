## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

>Example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.

-----
1. return smaller child path

[FAIL]
1. first version only return Math.min(left, right)+1;
2. but this is only valid for cases that current node have both childs, for only one child, the other has to be taken no matter how long the path is.

```java
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int left = minDepth(root.left);
        int right = minDepth(root.right);
        if (left==0 || right==0) {
            return left + right + 1; //the non zero length should be taken, this code is most concise
        }
        return Math.min(left, right)+1;
    }
```

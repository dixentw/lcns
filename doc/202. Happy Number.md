## 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

1. so if the input is not happy number, the program will hang.
2. [SOLUTION] - using Set to store the previous sum, if result is in set, it makes cycle Return false, if ends with 1, return true.

```java
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> loop = new HashSet<>();
        while (n != 1) {
            int sum = 0;
            int tmpNum = n;
            while (tmpNum > 0) {
                sum += (tmpNum % 10) * (tmpNum % 10);
                tmpNum /= 10;
            }
            n = sum;
            if (n == 1) return true;
            if (!loop.add(n)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

## 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Given a **non-negative** integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10^n.

**Example:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 91 
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, 
             excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99
```

1. naive: from 0 to pow(10, n), check each number are unique digit O(N)
2. 1123 is not unique.
3. basically this is the problem of given n length of digits, find all unique combinations count.
4. sum each segments 0~9, 10~99, 100~999 combination number.
5. the number of choice is from 0-9, 10 digits, the first can only chose 9.


>When n == 0, return 1. I got this answer from the test case.
>When n == 1, _ can put 10 digit in the only position. [0, ... , 10]. Answer is 10.
>When n == 2, _ _ first digit has 9 choices [1, ..., 9], second one has 9 choices excluding the >?>already chosen one. So totally 9 * 9 = 81. answer should be 10 + 81 = 91
>When n == 3, _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 = 684. answer is 10 + 81 + 648 = 739
>When n == 4, _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7.

```java
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        int cnt = 1;
        if (n == 0) return cnt;
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            int tmp = 9;
            for (int j=9 ; j>10-i; j--) {
                tmp *= j;
            }
            cnt += tmp;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
```

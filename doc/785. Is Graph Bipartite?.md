## 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

Given an undirected `graph`, return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is *bipartite* if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of indexes `j` for which the edge between nodes `i` and `j` exists.  Each node is an integer between `0` and `graph.length - 1`.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: `graph[i]` does not contain `i`, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
```

----

1. find two sets of node that every node in set have no edge to each other.
2. [SOLUTION] bipartite graph can be 2-colorable.
3. Pick up a BFS solution for that
4. [FAIL] : should for each node, do BFS. not just first node.

```java
   public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] color = new int[graph.length];
        for (int i=0; i<graph.length; i++) {
            if (color[i] != 0) continue;
            Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
            q.offer(i);
            color[i] = 1;
            while (!q.isEmpty()) {
                Integer currNode = q.poll();
                for (Integer child : graph[currNode]){
                    if (color[child] == 0) {
                        color[child] = - color[currNode];
                        q.offer(child); // forgot to offer child nodes at first time.
                    } else {
                        if (color[child] == color[currNode]) return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

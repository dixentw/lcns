## 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `L` and `R`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[L, R]` (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

Output: 
    1
      \
       2
```

1. traverse with this limit, if current root is exceed, return false. parent got the false, set the child to null
2. if parent is false:
   1. then set parent as it's child who return true and return true (it must have one child as true)
   2.  if both are false, then return false. no subsitution
3. if parent is true, trim the child and return true.

```java
    public TreeNode trimBSTRevised(TreeNode root, int L, int R) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        TreeNode left = trimBSTRevised(root.left, L, R);
        TreeNode right = trimBSTRevised(root.right, L, R);
        if (root.val < L) {
            return right;
        }
        if (root.val > R) {
            return left;
        }
        root.left = left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }
```

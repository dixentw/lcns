## 319. Bulb Switcher

There are *n* bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the *i*-th round, you toggle every *i* bulb. For the *n*-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after *n* rounds.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

1. naive : base on this algorithm to write donw the code. scan all bulbs and iteration takes O(n^2)
2. if a number have odd divisor, then will be on.
3. if a number have even factors, it will be off.

[SOLUTION]

1. the divisor is pair : 
   1.  36 -> `[1, 36], [2, 18], [3, 12],[4,9],[6,6]`
   2.  12 -> `[1, 12], [2, 6], [3, 4]`
2. the only way to get odd divisor is that number has integer square.
3. basically we count all the number with perfect square root.
4. for all perfect square root numbers less than N, is the sqrt(N), because `(sqrt(N)+1)^2` will larger then N, `sqrt(N)` integer part is the total count of number that have integer sqrt.
5. formula: sqrt(N)

```java
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
```

## 346. Moving Average from Data Stream

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

**Example:**

```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

1. using queue to get the oldest element that ready to pull out.
2. so that we can have O(1) solution for this problem.
3. trick : how to maintain the previous Sum;



```java
class MovingAverage {

    Queue<Integer> q;
    int max =0;
    double sum = 0;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        q = new LinkedList<>();
        max = size;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (q.size()==max) {
            sum -= q.poll();
            sum += val;
        } else {
            sum+=val;
        }
        q.offer(val);
        return sum / q.size();
    }
} 
```

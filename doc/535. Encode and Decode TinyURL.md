## 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

---

1. according to spec, we just need to translate any string to six characters.
2. this problem didn't contain any limitation as follow.
   1. how many urls we should keep in machine?
   2. this service is read heavy or write heavy?
   3. whether those url records need to have time duration
   4. not found case?
3. using naive implementation.

```java
public class LC535 {
    String chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890";
    String baseURL = "http://tinyurl.com/";
    Map<String, String> toShort = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, String> toLong = new HashMap<>();
    Random rand = new Random();

    public String genURL () {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i=0; i<6; i++) { //as spec in description
            int idx = Math.abs(rand.nextInt()) % chars.length();
            sb.append(chars.charAt(idx));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        if (toShort.containsKey(longUrl)) {
            return toShort.get(longUrl);
        }
        String ranchars = genURL();
        toShort.put(longUrl, baseURL+ranchars);
        toLong.put(baseURL+ranchars, longUrl);
        return baseURL+ranchars;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    public String decode(String shortUrl) {
        return toLong.get(shortUrl);
    }
}
```

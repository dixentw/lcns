## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(*n*) complexity.

**Example:**

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

----

1. create a array to count the occurence (the array will be Integer.MIN to Integer.MAX long, not pragmatic).
2. If I can sort it, I can make O(nlogn) solution by sorting it and found skipped element.
3. if there is a treemapâ€¦ the treemap is still O(nlogn)

[SOLUTION]

1. using hashmap, the update only take O(1)
2. the trickest part is update boundary
   1. for current element in sequence, it a) next to a seq, b) not next to a seq.
   2. if not next to a seq, then we save 1 with this element (the seq from itself)
   3. it this element is begin or end of certain sequence, we only check neighbor, get the seq count. that's why we only need to update boundary. or we need to update every number in seq of seq count.

```java
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> table = new HashMap<>();
        int res = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (!table.containsKey(n)) {
                int left = table.getOrDefault(n-1, 0);
                int right = table.getOrDefault(n+1, 0);
                int consecutives = left+right+1;
                table.put(n, consecutives);
                table.put(n-left, consecutives);
                table.put(n+right, consecutives);
                res = Math.max(res, consecutives);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

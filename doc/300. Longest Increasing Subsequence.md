## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:** 

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

1. dynamic programming problem
2. max function is `f[i]`, representing the max number of increasing sequence end with `i`
3. `f[i] = 1` if this element is smaller then all previous element, or `f[i] = f[previous, largest element] + 1`

```java
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length==0) return 0;
        int[] f = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(f, 1);
        int max = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<f.length; i++) {
            int maxVal = 0;
            for (int j=0; j<i;j++) {
                if (nums[i]>nums[j]) {
                    maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, f[j]);
                }
            }
            f[i] = maxVal+1;
            max = Math.max(max, f[i]);
        }
        return max;
    }
```

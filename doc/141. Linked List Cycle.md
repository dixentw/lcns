## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

1. fast-slow pointer, if they eventually meet, the there is a cycle.
2. [PROBLEM] forget about the init setting of fast and slow pointer, should assign fast and slow first then compare them.
3. 



```java
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        while (fast != null && slow != null && fast.next != null ) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (fast == slow) return  true;
            // if(fast.val == slow.val) don't need to compare value, since everything is operated as pointer, so the node only had one copy. the object reference should be the same.
        }
        return false;
    }
```

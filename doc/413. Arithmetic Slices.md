## 413. Arithmetic Slices

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:

```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```

The following sequence is not arithmetic.

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A. 

**Example:**

```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```

1. naive : for each pair of P and Q, identify if they are arithmetic, O(N^3)
2. if I can find the all arithmetic sequences, foreach seq, I can calculate all sub seqs. O(N)
3. this arithmetic seq must longer then 3 elements
4. **implementation detail : don't need to keep the start and end.**

```java
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] A) {
        if (A.length < 3) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        int len = 2;
        for (int i=2; i<A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i-1] - A[i-2] == A[i] - A[i-1]) {
                len++;
            } else {
                if (len > 2) {
                    res += (len-1)*(len-2)/2;
                }
                len = 2;
            }
        }
        if (len > 2) res += (len-1)*(len-2)/2;
        return res;
    }

    /*
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlicesIncomplete(int[] A) {
        if (A.length < 3 ) return 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        int start = 0;
        int end = 1;
        int diff = A[start] - A[end];
        while (end < A.length) {
           if( diff == (A[end] - A[start])) {
               m.put(start, end);
               end++;
           } else {
               diff = A[end] - A[start];

           }
        }
    }*/

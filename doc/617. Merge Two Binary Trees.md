## 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

>Example 1:
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
 ​         1                         2                             
 ​        / \                       / \                            
 ​       3   2                     1   3                        
 ​      /                           \   \                      
 ​     5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	​     3
	​    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7

1. recursive, merge sub tree , the merge self
2. the problem is keep parent? or we should do it from parent.
3. point: should create a new node, instead of using t1, I think it could make logic more easier.

```java
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if (t1==null && t2==null) {
            return null;
        } else if(t1==null && t2 != null) {
            return t2;
        } else if (t1!=null && t2==null) {
            return t1;
        } else {
            TreeNode tr = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
            tr.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
            tr.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
            return tr;
        }
    }
```

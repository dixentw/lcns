## 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two`or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. 

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the **second minimum** value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree. 

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
```

----

1. if a node has child, that node is smaller one
2. if there is a tree with full subnodes, then the second smaller one shold be in level 2.
3. but the node is not necessary different from each other nodes.
4. the only exception seems all nodes value are the same.
5. [SOLUTION] BFS, my favorite, but not comes out with it!

```java
    public int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode root) {
        int rootVal = root.val;
        int second = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root);
        while(!q.isEmpty()) {
            int n = q.size();
            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                if (curr.val != root.val && curr.val < second) second = curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
        }
        if (second != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return second;
        return -1;
    }
```

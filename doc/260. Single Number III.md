## 260. Single Number III

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**

```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

**Note**:

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

----

1. it's easy to come out with a XOR of that special two number
2. the twoXOR indicate that these two numbers must different in XOR's 1 position
3. we chose any 1 position, to separate numbers into two group, and we know that these two number will be separated.
4. since every number other than result will repeat, we can xor them to get the result.

```java
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int twoXor = 0;
        for (int n : nums) twoXor ^= n;
        int position = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<32; i++) {
            if (((twoXor >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                position = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        int one = 1 << position;
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for (int n : nums) {
            if ((n & one) > 0) {
                res[0] ^= n;
            } else {
                res[1] ^= n;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

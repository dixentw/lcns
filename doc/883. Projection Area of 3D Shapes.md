## 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes

On a `N * N` grid, we place some `1 * 1 * 1 `cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of grid cell `(i, j)`.

Now we view the *projection* of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21
```

1. from the top, the point itself is the area, count all number except `0`
2. from side, there are two side
   1. find the largest number alongside with x axis
   2. find the largest number alognside with y axis

```java
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int top = 0;
        int[] sideX = new int[grid.length];
        int[] sideY = new int[grid[0].length];
        for (int x=0; x<grid.length; x++) {
            for (int y=0; y<grid[0].length; y++) {
                if (grid[x][y] != 0) top++;
                if (grid[x][y] > sideX[x]) {
                    sideX[x] = grid[x][y];
                }
                if (grid[x][y] > sideY[y]) {
                    sideY[y] = grid[x][y];
                }
            }
        }
        int sumx = 0;
        for (int x : sideX) sumx += x;
        int sumy = 0;
        for (int y : sideY) sumy += y;
        return top + sumx + sumy;
    }
```

## 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

1. using recursive and reverse with count

```java
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        int len = 0;
        // count the length
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            len++;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        if (len < k) return head;
        ListNode[] res = reverse(head, k);
        head.next = reverseKGroup(res[0], k);
        return res[1];
    }
    public ListNode[] reverse(ListNode head, int count) {
        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (count>0) {
            ListNode n = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = n;
            count--;
        }
        return new ListNode[]{curr, prev};
    }
```

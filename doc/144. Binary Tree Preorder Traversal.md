## 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

>Example:
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
 â€‹    2
    /
   3
Output: [1,2,3]
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

----
1. point is iterative
2. very hard to remember... 
   1. conduction should be for a node and it's left and right node, don't think about the final result or final situation, just find out which node should come first to add to list, then stack other two.

```java
public List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) return res;
        Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();
        TreeNode curr = root;
        st.push(curr);
        while (!st.empty()) {
            curr = st.pop();
            res.add(curr.val);
            if (curr.right != null) st.push(curr.right);
            if (curr.left != null) st.push(curr.left);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

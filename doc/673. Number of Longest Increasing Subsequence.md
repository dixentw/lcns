## 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```



**Note:** Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.

1. not really like the DP, but the point is 
   1. define len[i]: the LIS length of current nums[i]
   2. define cnt[i]: the count of same length LIS in nums[i]
   3. for specific index `j`, we check len from `0` to `i, i<j`. if there are longer length than `len[j]`, we replace it with `len[i] + 1`.
   4. for the cnt, if we found `len[i] + 1` longer then len[j], which means we inherit `cnt[i]` in `j`
   5. if we found `len[i] + 1` equals to `len[j]`, that means they should aggregate together because those two group count share the same length.

```java
    public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] len = new int[nums.length];
        int[] cnt = new int[nums.length];
        int maxLen = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            len[i] = 1;
            cnt[i] = 1;
            for (int j=0; j<i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    if (len[j]+1 > len[i]) {
                        len[i] = len[j]+1;
                        cnt[i] = cnt[j];
                    } else if (len[j]+1 == len[i]) {
                        cnt[i] += cnt[j];
                    }
                }
            }
          // maintaining code, no need to explain
            if (maxLen == len[i]) res+=cnt[i];
            if (maxLen < len[i]) {
                maxLen = len[i];
                res = cnt[i];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

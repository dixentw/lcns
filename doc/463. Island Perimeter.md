## 463. Island Perimeter

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 

**Example:**

```
Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16
```

1. when we have one, then I have four sides, if I extended this block, it will add 4 and remove common side to 2 => 6
2. it's wrong, tho I didn't know why...
3. but if we count it with four direction, then the result is fine.

```java
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        int[] perimeter = new int[1];
        for (int i=0;i<grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j]==1) dfs (grid, i, j, perimeter);
            }
        }
        return perimeter[0];
    }
    public void dfs (int[][] grid, int x, int y, int[] perimeter) {
        if (x<0 || x>=grid.length||y<0||y>=grid[0].length) return;
        if (grid[x][y]!=1) return;
        grid[x][y] = -1;
        if (x<1||grid[x-1][y]==0) perimeter[0] ++;
        if (x>=grid.length-1||grid[x+1][y]==0) perimeter[0] ++;
        if (y<1||grid[x][y-1]==0) perimeter[0] ++;
        if (y>=grid[0].length-1||grid[x][y+1]==0) perimeter[0] ++;
        dfs(grid, x, y-1, perimeter);
        dfs(grid, x-1, y, perimeter);
        dfs(grid, x, y+1, perimeter);
        dfs(grid, x+1, y, perimeter);
        
    }
```

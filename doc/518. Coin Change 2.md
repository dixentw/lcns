## 518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.



 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```

----

1. the problem is about : find minimal coin number, or get all possible coin combination
2. for all posible combination, we recursivly get subproblem:
   1. the count from using `ith` coins
   2. the count form not using `ith` coins

### revise

1. and it feels like combination sum. but TLE

```java
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] res = new int[1];
        helper(amount, coins, res, 0);
        return res[0];
    }
    public void helper (int amount, int[] coins, int[] res, int start) {
        if (amount<0) return;
        if (amount==0) {
            res[0]++;
            return;
        }
        for (int i=start; i<coins.length; i++) {
            helper(amount-coins[i], coins, res, i);
        }
    }
```

2. Dynamic programming

   1. if we revert the two for loop, it will produce duplidate combination : 1,1,2 <> 1,2,1 <> 2,1,1 (?)

>If outer loop is amount, you are considering every coin at every stage.
>Let's start with amount 2: it can be made from 2 and 1 + 1, so 2 combinations. For amount 3 you would consider every coin again, which would mean that you're trying dp[amount - 1] and dp[amount - 2], which is: 2 (as there are 2 combinations for amount 2) and 1 (1 combination for amount 1).
>So in this case you have 3 combinations for amount 3:
>1 + 2 - taken from dp[amount - 2]
>2 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 - taken from dp[amount - 1]
>You can see is one duplicate: 1 + 2 and 2 + 1
>If outer loop is coins, you are NOT considering every coing at every stage
>Let's assume you've already calculated all dps for coin with value 1. So for every amount there is just one combination, dp array looks like that: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1...]
>Now we are doing all calculations with value 2. We are at amount 2, so again, amount 2 has 2 combinations: 1 + 1 and 2. Makes sense, no duplicates.
>For amount 3 you are NOT considering every coin again - you are just considering ending every combination with 2, so ONLY dp[amount - 2].
>That would make only two combinations for amount 3:
>1 + 1 + 1 - taken as previous value of dp[3], calculated for coin value 1
>1 + 2 - taken from dp[amount - 2]

Not really persuativeâ€¦. the backtrace code is more clear.

```java
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] f = new int[amount+1];
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i=0; i<coins.length;i++){
            for (int j=1; j<f.length; j++) {
                if (j>=coins[i]) {
                    f[j] += f[j-coins[i]];
                }
            }
        }
        return f[amount];
    }
```

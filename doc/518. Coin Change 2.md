## 518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.



 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```

----

1. the problem is about : find minimal coin number, or get all possible coin combination
2. for all posible combination, we recursivly get subproblem:
   1. the count from using `ith` coins
   2. the count form not using `ith` coins

### revise

1. and it feels like combination sum. but TLE

```java
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] res = new int[1];
        helper(amount, coins, res, 0);
        return res[0];
    }
    public void helper (int amount, int[] coins, int[] res, int start) {
        if (amount<0) return;
        if (amount==0) {
            res[0]++;
            return;
        }
        for (int i=start; i<coins.length; i++) {
            helper(amount-coins[i], coins, res, i);
        }
    }
```

## 137. Single Number II

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *three* times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

1. maintain a bit count of every number.
2. then mod 3, the remaining part is the answer.

```java
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int[] a = new int[32];
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<32; j++) {
                int b = (nums[i] >> j) & 1;
                if (b==1) a[j]++;
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<32; i++) {
            int part = (a[i] %3) << i;
            res = res | part;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## 86. Partition List

Given a linked list and a value *x*, partition it such that all nodes less than *x* come before nodes greater than or equal to *x*.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

1. use two dummy heads to keep all small and all large.
2. [FAIL] should set larger partition's tail to null

```java
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode dummyLess = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode dummyMore = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode currLess = dummyLess;
        ListNode currMore = dummyMore;
        while (head != null) {
            if (head.val < x) {
                currLess.next = head;
                currLess = currLess.next;
            } else {
                currMore.next = head;
                currMore = currMore.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        currMore.next = null;
        currLess.next = dummyMore.next;
        return dummyLess.next;
    }
```

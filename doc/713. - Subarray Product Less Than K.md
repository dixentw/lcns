## 713. - Subarray Product Less Than K


Your are given an array of positive integers nums.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than k.

>Example 1:
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

* Observation:
  * 當找到一段乘積小於K的elements時，代表裡面的所有排列都可以一次算好：e.g. `[5,2,6] = 6`
  * 怎麼找到那段？
    * divide and conquire -> too complicated, and the execution time is not O(n)
    * two pointers, one from start and one from end -> failed when there are many sections less than K
    * two pointers, both from start, **first I thought it is O(n^2)**, but actually, if both pointer not set back to zero, then the execution time should be O(2n)

```java
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        long p = 1l; //<-- trap, the init is 1
        int sum = 0;
        while (j < nums.length) {
            p *= nums[j];
            while (i <= j && p >= k) {
                p /= nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            sum += (j - i + 1);
            j++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```

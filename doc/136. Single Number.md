## 136. Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

1. get the sum -> dead end
2. how to eliminate duplicates? at this case, the number is nothing related with index
3. XOR is the answer

```java
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length==0) return 0;
        int res = nums[0];
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            res = res^nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
```

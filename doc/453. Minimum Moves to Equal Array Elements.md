## 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

Given a **non-empty** integer array of size *n*, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing *n* - 1 elements by 1.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```



------

1. didn't get the question at the first time. It states, that, each time, we can add n-1's element with 1 at whatever elements. Each move we need to pick `n-1` element to add `1`.
2. which means the same for each move substract 1 from one element.
3. two pass, first get the smallest one, then everybody substract the smallest.

```java
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i< nums.length; i++) {
            min = Math.min(min, nums[i]);
        }
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            diff += nums[i] - min;
        }
        return diff;
    }
```

## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

>Example:
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6
Output: 6

1. BFS, log(n)
2. the number must be `2^0 + 2^1 + ... +2^(h-1) + 1~2^h = 2^h-1 + 1~2^h`
3. how to count the last level fast?
   1. take root->right child all the way to the left.
   2. take root->left child all the way to the right.
   3. **I stopped at using recursive to count other situation**

```java
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int levelLeft = helperLeft(root.left);
        int middle = helperLeft(root.right);
        int count = 1;
        if (levelLeft == middle) { // the left subtree is full
            count += (1<<levelLeft) - 1;
            count += countNodes(root.right);
        } else { // the right is full at height-1, left is not complete
            count += (1<<middle) -1;
            count += countNodes(root.left);
        }
        return count;
    }
    public int helperLeft(TreeNode node) {
        int i = 0;
        TreeNode cur = node;
        while (cur != null) {
            cur = cur.left;
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
```

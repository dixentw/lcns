## 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

>Example 1:
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

>Example 2:
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

* Observation: 
  * 看到1就是一定要拿走兩個，0的話一定是拿一個
  * index的結束條件：剛好停在最後一個0, 所以是 **i == bits.length-1**，程式裡面，當迴圈結束的前一個，i==bits.length的時候，就GG

```java
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int i=0;
        while (i < bits.length-1) {
            if (bits[i]==1) {
                i += 2;
            }else{
                i++;
            }
            if (i==bits.length) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

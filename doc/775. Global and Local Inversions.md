## 775. Global and Local Inversions

* count local inversion O(n)
* count global inversion ??
  * naive is two loops, check all elements before current element
* plus both to get the result.

[Solution] - pay attention to the true question : **only judge their equality**

* all local inversions are global inversions
* if glabal inversions equals local inversions
  * which means we cannot find a `A[i]>A[j], i+1<j`
  * so it kindof sorted array.
  * which means the max before `A[i]`, cannot larger than `A[i+2]`

```java
    public boolean isIdealPermutation(int[] A) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<A.length-2; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, A[i]);
            if (max > A[i+2]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```


* or follow this thought down,
* for only local inversion: val of `A[i]` can only place in `A[i-1], A[i], A[i+1]`
* so we check `A[i] - i = {-1, 0, 1}` is enough.

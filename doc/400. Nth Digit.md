## 400. Nth Digit

Find the *n*th digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... 

**Note:**
*n* is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (*n* < 231).

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
3

Output:
3
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
```

1. String append the values, and get the givin index count
2. 11/10 = (1,1), 12/10=(1,2) , the mod need to divide 2.
3. 1~9 : 9
4. 10~99: 90 * 2 = 180
5. 100~999 : 900 * 3 = 2700
6. for a number N, keep minus 9 * 10^M * bases, to see which range it locate
7. say, if we found N located in 10~99, 

```java
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {
        long base = 9; 
        long digits = 1;
        while (n > base*digits/*possible overflow here, need to use long*/) {
            n -= (int) base*digits;
            base *= 10;
            digits++;
        }
        //get the number, we count from 10, but we minus 999... so the n should minus 1
        long num = (long) Math.pow(10, digits-1) + (n-1)/digits;
        //get the digit
        int idx = (n-1) % (int)digits;
        //trick to get desired digit, we can stringify number and get indexed character as well.
        for (int i=idx; i<digits-1; i++) {
            num /= 10;
        }
        return (int)num % 10;
    }
```

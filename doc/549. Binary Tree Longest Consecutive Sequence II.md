## 549. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II

Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

>Example 1:
Input:
 ​       1
 ​      / \
 ​     2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
Example 2:
Input:
 ​       2
 ​      / \
 ​     1   3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].

----

1. the difference:
   1. not just adding one is valid, minus one is valid between two nodes
   2. child-parent-child is allowed.
2. for each node, get the longest sub tree can have, then check the sub root with current root's relation?
   1. not very promise because how to extends the path?
3. maybe from I, find the longest consecutive, then try to connect it? X
4. [SOLUTION]
   1. the longest path has four possibility:
      1. from left to right, passing thought root, is increase, vise versa
      2. from left to right, passing thought root, is decrease, vise versa
      3. return from left 
      4. return from right

```java
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        //path pass throught root
        int l1 = helper(root.left, root.val, -1) + helper(root.right, root.val, 1) + 1;
        int l2 = helper(root.left, root.val, 1) + helper(root.right, root.val, -1) + 1;
        int childLongL = longestConsecutive(root.left);
        int childLongR = longestConsecutive(root.right);
        int cpc = Math.max(l1 , l2);
        int c = Math.max(childLongL, childLongR);
        return Math.max(cpc, c);
    }
    public int helper(TreeNode root, int parent, int diff) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (root.val == parent+diff) {
            int left = helper(root.left, root.val, diff);
            int right = helper(root.right, root.val, diff);
            return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```



>Hence this question actually contains 2 subproblems to solve:
1. what is the longest **increasing** consecutive parent-child path sequence given a `root` node?
2. what is the longest **decreasing** consecutive parent-child path sequence given a `root` node?
Based on the above 2 sub-solution, we know that the longest consecutive sequence for a given `root` is `longest_increasing_sequence + longest_decreasing_sequence` from this `root`. We can simply add up this 2 value because the longest increasing consecutive sequence and longest decreasing consecutive sequence is guaranteed to showed up in different child path (otherwise there will be a contradiction--a child's value cannot be greater than and less than the root's value at the same time).
If the root's value's value is not consecutive with a child's value, then the length of current sequence is simply 1.

```java
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        int[] max = new int[1];
        helper(root, max);
        return max[0];
    }
    public int[] helper(TreeNode root, int[] max) {
        if (root == null) return new int[]{0, 0};
        int inc = 1;
        int dec = 1;
        //the longest consecutive path from this root!
        if (root.left != null) {
            int[] l = helper(root.left, max);
            if (root.val == root.left.val + 1) {
                dec = Math.max(dec, l[1] + 1);
            } else if (root.val == root.left.val - 1){
                inc = Math.max(inc, l[0] + 1);
            }
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            int[] r = helper(root.right, max);
            if (root.val == root.right.val + 1) {
                dec = Math.max(dec, r[1]+1);
            } else if (root.val == root.right.val - 1) {
                inc = Math.max(inc, r[0]+1);
            }
        }
        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], inc+dec-1);
        return new int[]{inc, dec};
    }

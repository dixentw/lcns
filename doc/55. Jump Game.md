## 55. Jump Game

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

1. classic DP problem.
2. how to find the sub problem? for `pos[i]`, if all previous position cover this pos at `i`, then `pos[i]` is valid.
3. but here introduce the previous scan, so that it probably not O(N)
4. this problem's trick is to define for a position `i`, `DP[i]` is the max remain step that I can go. If max step is 0, then I cannot go further. check the last position if the step is larger then 0
5. another thinking is like [5,1,1,1] => (apply 5) [1,1,1,1] => apply 1[1,1,2,1] => apply 1[1,1,2,2], but that still require extra loop

```java
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int[] remainStep = new int[nums.length];
        remainStep[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            remainStep[i] = Math.max(remainStep[i-1], nums[i-1]) - 1;
            if (remainStep[i] < 0) return false; // exit early, or latter pos will not be zero.
        }
        return remainStep[nums.length-1] >= 0;
    }
```

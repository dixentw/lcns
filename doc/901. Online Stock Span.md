## 901. Online Stock Span

Write a class `StockSpanner` which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the *span* of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
```

1. It's monotonic queue/stack problem, but how to know which structure I need to use?
2. how to maintain the span if monotoic queue/stack should pop out the elements?

[SOLUTION]

1. the queue and stack are both work for this problem.
2. the result can save to the element, so we still can perform the monotonic algorithm.

```java
class StockSpanner {
    Stack<int[]> store;
    public StockSpanner() {
        store = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        int res = 1;
        while (!store.isEmpty() && store.peek()[0] <= price) {
            res += store.pop()[1];
        }
        store.push(new int[]{price, res});
        return res;
    }
}
```

* don't know why deque version is faster

```java
class StockSpanner {
    Deque<int[]> store;
    public StockSpanner() {
        store = new ArrayDeque<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        int res = 1;
        while (!store.isEmpty() && store.peekLast()[0] <= price) {
            res += store.pollLast()[1];
        }
        store.offerLast(new int[]{price, res});
        return res;
    }
}
```

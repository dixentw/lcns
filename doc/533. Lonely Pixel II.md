## 533. Lonely Pixel II

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row R and column C that align with all the following rules:

Row R and column C both contain exactly N black pixels.
For all rows that have a black pixel at column C, they should be exactly the same as row R
The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

>Example:
Input:                                            
[['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']] 

>N = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: All the bold 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column 1 and 3).
 â€‹       0    1    2    3    4    5         column index                                            
0    [['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
1     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
2     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
3     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]    
row index

>Take 'B' at row R = 0 and column C = 1 as an example:
Rule 1, row R = 0 and column C = 1 both have exactly N = 3 black pixels. 
Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column C = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row R = 0.

---
1. feel that I can reuse the previous calculation of row and col B's count.
2. this time we need to return B's count
3. the rule #2 is difficult to understand, but basically, it said that before add thoese eligible 'B', we still need to check that every row in that column are the same.

```java
    public int findBlackPixel(char[][] picture, int N) {
        int[] rowCnt = new int[picture.length];
        int[] colCnt = new int[picture[0].length];
        for (int i=0; i<picture.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<picture[0].length; j++) {
                if (picture[i][j]=='B') {
                    rowCnt[i]++;
                    colCnt[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<rowCnt.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<colCnt.length; j++) {
                if (rowCnt[i] == N && colCnt[j] == N && picture[i][j]=='B') {
                    boolean broke = false;
                    String curr = Arrays.toString(picture[i]);
                    for (int k=0; k<picture.length; k++) {
                        if (picture[k][j] == 'B' && !curr.equals(Arrays.toString(picture[k]))) {
                            broke = true;
                        }
                    }
                    if (!broke) res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

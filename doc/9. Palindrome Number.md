## 9. Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

1. if number < 0, it is false
2. naive is to read digits to array, then start and ene pointer
3. read from back, then find a way to get the largest digit?
4. [SOLUTION] reverse from back and compare them.

```java
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || x!=0 && x %10==0) return false;
        int reverse = 0;
        while (x > reverse) {
            reverse = reverse*10 + x%10;
            x = x/10;
        }
        return x==reverse || x == reverse/10; // odd digits case
    }
```

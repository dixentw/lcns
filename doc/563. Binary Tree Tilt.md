## 563. Binary Tree Tilt

Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

>Example:
Input: 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

----

1. for each node, it have left subtree's tile, but not includ the left tree's root, the left child it self
2. I can get the abs at the root, just keep return the sum of subtree is fine.
3. [FAIL] the tilt of all tree is the sum of all tilt!!!

```java
    public int findTilt(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int l = sum(root.left);
        int r = sum(root.right);
        int lt = findTilt(root.left); // didn't come out 
        int rt = findTilt(root.right);
        return Math.abs(l-r) + lt + rt;
    }
    public int sum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int sLeft = sum(root.left);
        int sRight = sum(root.right);
        return sLeft + sRight + root.val;
    }
```

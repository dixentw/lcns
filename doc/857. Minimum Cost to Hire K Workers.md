## 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

There are `N` workers.  The `i`-th worker has a `quality[i]` and a minimum wage expectation `wage[i]`.

Now we want to hire exactly `K` workers to form a *paid group*.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.

Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
```

----
1. directly goto solution
2. the naive is at least one worker will be paid with his minimal wage.
3. for every worker, we calculate its paid ratio (`wage / quality`), and calculate every worker's wage by that ratio, kick out who is not satisfied to form the K group.
4. 3 is very complex to write.
5. the key insight here is sort by that ratio, we can try from smallest to biggest ratio, the minimal is happen along the path.
6. at the same time, since every worker use the same ratio, so, get the minimal total quality with K in group is needed.
7. [POINT] - for maxHeap, if we kick out current worker's quality, can we use his ratio? 
   1. the quality group of K before current worker, will be calculated with smaller ration then current ratio, so it dosen't affect the answer.

```java
    class Worker {
        int quality;
        int wage;
        double ratio;
        public Worker(int q, int w) {
            this.quality = q;
            this.wage = w;
            this.ratio = (double) wage / (double) quality;
        }
    }
    public double mincostToHireWorkers(int[] quality, int[] wage, int K) {
        List<Worker> ws = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=0; i<quality.length; i++) {
            ws.add(new Worker(quality[i], wage[i]));
        }
        Collections.sort(ws, (a, b)-> Double.compare(a.ratio, b.ratio));
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pool = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b-a);
        int totalQ = 0;
        double res = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (Worker curr : ws) {
            pool.offer(curr.quality);
            totalQ += curr.quality;
            if (pool.size() > K) {
                totalQ -= pool.poll();
            }
            if (pool.size()==K) {
                res = Math.min(res, curr.ratio * totalQ); 
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

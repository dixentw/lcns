## 528. Random Pick with Weight

iven an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1. `1 <= w.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
3. `pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array `w`. `pickIndex` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

1. how to get the expect result if that is random?
2. [SOLUTION] the way to get the random weight
   1. sum all, then count each probability: no method support
   2. find the range, that for a list `[2,5,3,4]`, if I can find [XXYYYYYZZZEEEE], then it seems fine that I have nextInt in SUM[14].
   3. find the point to locate the index.

```java
class Solution {

    int[] accuWeight;
    Random random;
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        random = new Random();
        accuWeight = new int[w.length];
        accuWeight[0] = w[0];
        for (int i=1; i<w.length; i++) {
            accuWeight[i] = accuWeight[i-1] + w[i]; 
        }
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int rv = random.nextInt(accuWeight[accuWeight.length-1])+1; // the range should be 1 to N (the method return 0 to N-1)
        int start = 0;
        int end = accuWeight.length-1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            if (accuWeight[mid] == rv) {
                return mid;
            } else if (accuWeight[mid] < rv) {
                start = mid + 1;  
            } else {
                end = mid; // wrong original : end = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```

## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

1. DFS algorithm? How to come out of rule to be rectangle?

[SOLUTION]

1. There exist a naive solution O(N^3): for each point, if the point is 1, then count add upper rows area to find the max
1. DP
   1. for each position `(i, j)`, the rectangle can be compute from upper row. we keep left and right and height, and the max area.
   2. the right is smallest upper rights, the left is largest upper left. the height is previous height +1 or zero if current position is `0`
   3. This search finds all possible rectangle, will include largest rectangle

## 255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree

Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

>Consider the following binary search tree: 
     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
Example 1:
Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
Example 2:
Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true

---
1. the naive: pre-order traverse the tree to get the array and comapre to given array.
2. NO, there is no given tree. just check the given array is correct binary tree preorder traversal
3. first, preorder meains => [root, left node..., right nodes...]
4. left nodes must be lass than right nodes. > use it to confirm the split.
5. right nodes must larger than first element.
6. left nodes all must smaller than first element. > use it to find pivot

[FAIL] 
1. no consider only one child case.
2. should recursivly test each part of array.
3. about the recursion, can put limit to it, and compare elements with limit! like valid binary tree!

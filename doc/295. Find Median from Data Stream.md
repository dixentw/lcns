## 295. Find Median from Data Stream

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,

```
[2,3,4]`, the median is `3
[2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
```

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

- void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
- double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

 

**Example:**

```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
```

----

1. previouly heard of the need of heap, but didn't get the idea of how to get median out of heap
2. it turns out that we need two heaps, for lower part of number stream and upper part of number stream. if we apply min heap to upper part of numbers and max heap to lower part of numbers, then we always can get median from those two heaps.
3. if numbers are even: then we get two values from min heap and max heap, get the average. if numbers are odd, then return one of heap (arbitrarily decide which heap come first).

```java
class MedianFinder {

    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    PriorityQueue<Integer> lo;
    PriorityQueue<Integer> hi;
    public MedianFinder() {
        lo = new PriorityQueue<>(10, Collections.reverseOrder());
        hi = new PriorityQueue<>();
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        lo.offer(num);
        hi.offer(lo.poll()); // need to do it every time, this is the only way to balance tree, consider lo : 3, hi:3, then comes with a largest number, it will put directly to lo, going to get wrong answer. So we always do balancing.
        if (lo.size() < hi.size()) { // after balancing, we check size.
            lo.offer(hi.poll());
        }
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        if (lo.size() == hi.size()) return (double)(lo.peek() + hi.peek())/2;
        else return lo.peek();
    }
}


```

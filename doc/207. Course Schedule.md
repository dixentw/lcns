## 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

----

1. create a graph,
2. using topological sort, which is checking indegree make sure the first vertex is indegree 0, and test if we can run over all vertext.
3. first implementation cannot create a Adjacent List corret, for 0->2, 1->2, 2 will be create twice.
4. failed at handling loop

```java
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        for (int[] pair : prerequisites) { //O(V)
            indegree[pair[0]]++;
            List<Integer> vs = graph.getOrDefault(pair[1], new ArrayList<>());
            vs.add(pair[0]);
            graph.put(pair[1], vs);
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i=0;i < indegree.length; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) { //O(E)
            cnt++;
            int v = q.poll();
            System.out.println(v);
            for (int n : graph.getOrDefault(v, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (--indegree[n]==0) q.offer(n); // this trick can solve loop and double direct, for case like 1->2, 3->2. 2 will count twice.
            }
        }
        return cnt == numCourses;
    }
```

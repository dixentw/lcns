## 269. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
] 

Output: "" 

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

----

1. with hint of topological sort, it's not hard to get to the solution
2. the problem is how to get graph
   1. the first word is not use for check direction, every character's direction is compare with previous word's same position character
   2. once we get the direction, we can stop compare latter (with alphabetic order, the rest is not relevent)

```java
    public String alienOrder(String[] words) {
        Map<Character, List<Character>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        int[] inorder = new int[26];
        // create nodes
        for (String w : words) {
            for (char c : w.toCharArray()) {
               if (!graph.containsKey(c)) graph.put(c, new ArrayList<>());
            }
        }
        // create order
        String prev = words[0];
        for (int i=1; i<words.length; i++) {
            String curr = words[i];
            for (int j=0; j<Math.min(prev.length(), curr.length()); j++) {
                if (prev.charAt(j) != curr.charAt(j)) {
                    graph.get(prev.charAt(j)).add(curr.charAt(j));    
                    inorder[curr.charAt(j)-'a']++;
                    break;
                }
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
        // BFS sort
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        Queue<Character> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (char c : graph.keySet()) {
            if (inorder[c-'a']==0) q.offer(c);
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            char node = q.poll();
            res.append(node);
            for (char child : graph.get(node)) {
                inorder[child-'a']--;
                if (inorder[child-'a']==0) q.offer(child);   
            }
        }
        if(res.length() != graph.size()) return "";
        return res.toString();
    }

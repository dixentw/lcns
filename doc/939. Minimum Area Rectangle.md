## 939. Minimum Area Rectangle

Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
Output: 2
```

------

1. naive: pick four points and try to make them a rectangle. get the smallest area to return. O(N^4)
2. but we know that to decide a rectangle, we just need two points. We can enumerate all pair of points to get mininal area and save the point into map to look up other two points. => reduce to O(N^2)
3. **consider the non such rectangle condition!!** should return 0.
4. the method to get another two points is tricky enough.

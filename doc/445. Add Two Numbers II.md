## 445. Add Two Numbers II

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Follow up:**
What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.

**Example:**

```
Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
```

1. the first thought is to reverse the link list, so this problem will be the same as add two numbers
2. with extra space, read them to integer
3. extra space is correct, but not to integer. I started to see no point here.

```java
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        Stack<ListNode> st1 = new Stack<>();
        Stack<ListNode> st2 = new Stack<>();
        while (l1 != null) {
            st1.push(l1);
            l1 = l1.next;
        }
        while (l2 != null) {
            st2.push(l2);
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode curr = null;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (!st1.empty() || !st2.empty()) {
            int num1 = 0;
            int num2 = 0;
            if (!st1.empty()) num1 = st1.pop().val;
            if (!st2.empty()) num2 = st2.pop().val;
            int sum = num1+num2+carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            curr = new ListNode(sum%10);
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
        }
        if (carry != 0) {
            curr = new ListNode(carry);
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
        }
        return curr;
    }
```

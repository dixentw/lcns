## 322. Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money *amount*. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Note**:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

1. It need smallest coins, which is same with combination sum with path that shortest. (TLE)
2. DP with tow fashion:
   1. the optimal function is defined as `F(S)`, the smallest coins for `S` amount. then sub problem is become `F(S) = F(S-C) + 1`
   2. Top down : it looks like recursion with count saved in array

```java
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] counts = new int[amount+1];
        return helper(coins, amount, counts);
    }
    public int helper(int[] coins, int amount, int[] counts) {
        if (amount < 0) return -1;
        if (amount == 0) return 0;
        if (counts[amount] != 0) return counts[amount];
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i=0 ;i<coins.length; i++) {
            int res = helper(coins, amount-coins[i], counts);
            if (res >= 0) min = Math.min(min, res+1);
        }
        counts[amount] = (min == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : min;
        return counts[amount];
    }
```
   3. Bottom up : `F(S)` is calculate as Min of F(S) or F(S-C), then F is guarentee the smallest

```java
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] f = new int[amount+1];
        Arrays.fill(f, amount+1);
        f[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<=amount; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<coins.length; j++) {
                if (coins[j] <= i) {
                    f[i] = Math.min(f[i], f[i-coins[j]]+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return (f[amount] == amount+1) ? -1 : f[amount];
    }
```

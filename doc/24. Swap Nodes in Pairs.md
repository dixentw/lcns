## 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

**Note:**

- Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
- You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

---

1. the hard part is you only know next node at given node, so that if we use prev to point the previous one, it will get better.
2. add dummy node to make it easier
3. at dummy, reverse later two, and keep going on.
4. don't have to check curr != null ,because the assignment in loop guareentee not null.

```java
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode curr = dummy;
        while (curr.next != null && curr.next.next != null) {
            ListNode later = curr.next.next;
            ListNode former = curr.next;
            curr.next = later;
            former.next = later.next;
            later.next = former;
            curr = former;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
```

## 814. Binary Tree Pruning

We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

```
Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.

1. know about using pruneTree to recurse, but not know how to do it actually.
2. utilize return TreeNode, we can prune tree from the leave.

```java
    public TreeNode pruneTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        root.left = pruneTree(root.left);
        root.right = pruneTree(root.right);
        if (root.val == 0 && root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return root;
    }
```

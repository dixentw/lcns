## 298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

>Example 1:
Input:
   1
    \
 ​    3
    / \
   2   4
 ​       \
 ​        5
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
>Example 2:
Input:
   2
    \
 ​    3
    / 
   2    
  / 
 1
Output: 2 
Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

----
1. helper(TreeNode node, TreeNode Parent) 
2. need to collect path and collect the max path > helper(TreeNode node, TreeNode parent, List<Integer> path).
3. this is not enough, cannot pass the longest list back to root, need to add List<List<Integer>> to collect the paths.
[FAIL]
1. 1->2->4, cannot preserve the 1->2 when 4 is add in
```java
if (parent.val == node.val-1) {
    path.add(node.val);
} else {
    path.clear();
    path.add(node.val);
}
```
1. how best solution handle the root  init problem?  since root compare with is value is equal, so, root didn't count as path. the first method call can merged into helper function.
2. the point : need to calculate max when it has valid sequence every time.

```java
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int[] max = new int[1];
        newHelper(root, 0, root.val, max);
        return max[0];
    }
    public void newHelper(TreeNode node, int curr, int target, int[] max) {
        if (node == null) return;
        if (node.val == target+1) curr++;
        else curr = 1;
        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], curr);
        newHelper(node.left, curr, node.val, max);
        newHelper(node.right, curr, node.val, max);
    }
```

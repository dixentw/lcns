## 755. Pour Water

We are given an elevation map, heights[i] representing the height of the terrain at that index. The width at each index is 1. After V units of water fall at index K, how much water is at each index?

Water first drops at index K and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index. Then, it flows according to the following rules:

* If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.
* Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right.
* Otherwise, rise at it's current position.

----

1. check every index with lower then drop index, then fill them 
2. if they are the same, keep drop let at the index
3. we can calculate the lower part at first
   1. if droplet cannot fill it. **hardest part**, fill the lowest first
   2. droplet equals, then return
   3. droplet exceed, how to arrang it?
4. or just run each droplet in rules above.
   1. It seems fine with time complexity

```java
    public int[] pourWater(int[] heights, int V, int K) {
        while (V-- > 0) {
            // find lowest
            int lowest = K;
            for (int i=K-1; i>=0; i--) {
                if (heights[i] > heights[lowest]) {
                    break;
                } else if (heights[i] < heights[lowest]) {
                    lowest = i;
                }
            }
            if (lowest != K) {
                heights[lowest]++;
            } else {
                for (int i=K+1; i<heights.length; i++) {
                    if (heights[i] > heights[lowest]) {
                        break;
                    } else if (heights[i] < heights[lowest]) {
                        lowest = i;
                    }
                }
                heights[lowest]++;
            }
        }
        return heights;
    }
```

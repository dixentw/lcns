## 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

Given a binary tree rooted at `root`, the *depth* of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is *deepest* if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]

1. get the depth is simple

2. get the deepest depth is simple,

3. two pass, find the depth and deepest depth, then find the corresponing node. no easy to find. cannot use child to find parent.

4. maintains list? no, when deepest happen, cannot guarantee it is the max(not all nodes traversed)

5. BFS, with some modification:

6. [SOLUTION] 

7. > The idea it to propogate a depth `val` until we reach a `null` and then return back the maximum depth that was found in the subtree. If both the left and right subtree return the same depth, which is also equal to the maximum depth of tree, update the result.

```java
    public TreeNode subtreeWithAllDeepest(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        int dl = depth(root.left);
        int dr = depth(root.right);
        if (dl==dr) return root; // it is top down, so the first encounter is that node with deepest nodes.
        if (dl > dr) return subtreeWithAllDeepest(root.left);
        else return subtreeWithAllDeepest(root.right);
    }
    public int depth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return Math.max(depth(root.left), depth(root.right)) + 1;
    }
```

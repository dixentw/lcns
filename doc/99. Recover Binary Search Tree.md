## 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```

**Follow up:**

- A solution using O(*n*) space is pretty straight forward.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

-----

1. the naive : reorder current tree and recursively reorder left and right (this is wrong answer).
2. we can do inorder traversal and store element in array, then change it. space O(N)
3. we use prev pointer, when prev large then current node, mark prev as inver1, by definition, I only need to find another disordered element latter.
4. the disordered second element should take curr node.

```java
class Solution {
    TreeNode prev;
    TreeNode first;
    TreeNode second;
    public void recoverTree(TreeNode root) {
        inorder(root);
        int tmp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = tmp;
    }
    public void inorder (TreeNode root) {
        if (root==null) return;
        inorder(root.left);
        if (prev!=null && prev.val >= root.val) {
            if (first == null) first = prev; // notice : prev
            second = root; // notice : root
        }
        prev = root;
        inorder(root.right);
    }
}
```

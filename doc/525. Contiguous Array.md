## 525. Contiguous Array

Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```



**Note:** The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

1. first thought is to find a K, that i-j = 2k, but it is hard to find it with pre sum tech
2. change the 0 to -1 to sum it, then now we know once preSum[j]  = preSum[i] , they have same number of 0 and 1
   1. proof: preSun[j] - preSum[i] means sum[i+1:j] is 0, which means same 1 and -1.

```java
    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, -1);
        int sum = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i]==0) sum--;
            else sum++;
            if (map.containsKey(sum)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i-map.get(sum));
            } else {
                map.put(sum, i);
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
```

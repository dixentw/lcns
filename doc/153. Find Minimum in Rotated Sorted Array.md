## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
Find the minimum element.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

>Example 1:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

----

1. naive : O(n) traverse all element to find the minimal
2. better solution would be binary search to find the smallest element. O(n)
   1. every time I split the array into 2 array, then the rotate is happend in one side
   2. if (mid < start) then rotate is happen before mid, end = mid-1
   3. what is the stop point?
3. [SOLUTION] 
   1. the smallest element is happened when `nums[smallest] < nums[smallest -1]`, because array is ascending.
   2. always remember how to define rotate m<=s

```java
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length-1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            if (mid > 0 && nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]) { //found the smallest
                return nums[mid];
            }
            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid] && nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
```

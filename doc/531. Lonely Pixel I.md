## 531. Lonely Pixel I

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

A black lonely pixel is character 'B' that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.

>Example:
>Input: 
>[['W', 'W', 'B'],
>['W', 'B', 'W'],
>['B', 'W', 'W']]
>Output: 3
>Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.

1. kind like previous LC#73, set matrix zero
2. or 3 passes? first get column B's count, second get Row B's count, then find column and row with both 1? a bit lousy, but I found the key point in  discussion:

```java
    public int findLonelyPixel(char[][] picture) {
        int[] rowCnt = new int[picture.length];
        int[] colCnt = new int[picture[0].length];
        for (int i=0; i<picture.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<picture[0].length; j++) {
                if (picture[i][j] == 'B') {
                    rowCnt[i] += 1;
                    colCnt[j] += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<rowCnt.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<colCnt.length; j++) {
                // also check pic[i][j] is Black is the key.
                if (picture[i][j]=='B' && rowCnt[i]==1 && colCnt[j]==1) res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

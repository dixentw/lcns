## 666. Path Sum IV

If the depth of a tree is smaller than `5`, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

1. The hundreds digit represents the depth `D` of this node, `1 <= D <= 4.`
2. The tens digit represents the position `P` of this node in the level it belongs to, `1 <= P <= 8`. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree. 
3. The units digit represents the value `V` of this node, `0 <= V <= 9.`



Given a list of `ascending` three-digits integers representing a binary with the depth smaller than 5. You need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
```

---

1. enumerate all path from top to leaves, and find the elements in array to sum.
2. 11->21->31->41, 11, 21,31,42
3. recursive is possible?
4. didn't complete
5. [SOLUTION], buttom up, the root of all its sub nodes, will contribute the multiplyer for that nodes.

```java
    public int pathSum(int[] nums) {
        int[][] leaves = new int[5][9]; //represent how many times it should multiply for calculate path sum. the root is multiply most time
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=nums.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
            int d = nums[i] / 100;
            int idx = nums[i]%10 / 10;
            if (leaves[d][idx] == 0) leaves[d][idx] = 1;
            leaves[d-1][(idx+1)/2] += leaves[d][idx];
            res += nums[i]%10 * leaves[d][idx];
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## 731. My Calendar II

* 跟前面差不多，同一個time slot可以多塞一個event 進去
* 跟前面一樣用tree map作，遇到一樣的key, value就多塞一筆進去
* 調ceiling 跟floor要多往前找一筆來對
  * no, 要一路往前看到end有交叉的地方

>The big idea is pretty simple:
>Each time of `book`, instead of `fail` a book when there is 1 or more `overlap` with existing books as in `MyCalendar I`, we just want to make sure these overlaps does not overlap - having `overlap` is now ok, but `overlapped` period cannot be `overlapped` again.
>So we just need to keep track of all the `overlaps` with any previous `books`

* 可以reuse mycalendar

```java
class MyCalendarTwo {

    private List<Integer[]> books;
    
    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        books = new ArrayList<Integer[]>();
    }
    
    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        //每次都需要重新開overlap是因為我們每次要加時段，都要重頭掃到尾，這樣之前留下來的紀錄很快就會讓我們overlap了。
        MyCalendar overlap = new MyCalendar();
        for (Integer[] b: books) {
            if (!(b[0]>=end || b[1]<=start)) {
                if (!overlap.book(Math.max(b[0], start), Math.min(b[1], end))) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

        }
        books.add(new Integer[]{start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```

## 343. Integer Break

Given a positive integer *n*, break it into the sum of **at least** two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

**Note**: You may assume that *n* is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

----

1. the principle would be break as much element as possible. with all 2 or 3 
2. (don't know why) but it works actually. 
3. still don't know how to distribute  -> maybe as much 3 as possible is the max sum.

```java
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        int product = 1;
        if (n==2) return 1;
        if (n==3) return 2;
        while (n > 4) {
            product *= 3;
            n = n-3;
        }
        product *= n;
        return product;
    }
```

## 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:** 

```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

1. didn't get the problem correct, it means to construct the longest palindrome from given characters
2. the next follow thought would be: get freqeunce of each character, if we can find a pair, then they contribute the length.
3. if the frequency is even, then they can contribute all to len
4. if the frequency is odd, then if len is even, it can contribute it to odd (this is the longest, and never be changed after adding other character's frequence)

```java
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0)+1);
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int freq : map.values()) {
            if (freq%2 ==0) res+=freq;
            else {
                res += freq/2 * 2;
                if (res%2==0) res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

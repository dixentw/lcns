## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

* [OB]
  * different from 121, you can buy more than one time.
  * which means maybe we collect all rise of prices would be the max profit
    * `[7,1,5,3,6,4]` -> 1->5, 3->6 => to 7
  * we cannot buy and sell at the same time.
  * which means that we need consolidate the rising part of array
  * when encountered the drop, move start to latter rising part

```java
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int result = 0;
        if (prices.length < 2) {
            return result;
        }
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<prices.length; i++) {
            int diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            if ( diff > 0) {
                end = i;
            } else {
                if (end > start) {
                    result += prices[end] - prices[start];
                }
                start = i;
            }
        }
        if (end > start) {
            result += prices[end] - prices[start];
        }
        return result;
    }
```

### revise 

1. dynamic programming :
2. let's check ith day buy and sell array. the buy and sell can only follow the rule
   1. I don't do buy and sell at day i : (using buy[i-1], sell[i-1])
   2. I buy at day i : using max sell[i-1] - prices[i] (buy)
   3. I sell at day i : using max buy[i-1] + prices[i] (sell)
   4. the last sell is the answer

```java
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices.length<2) return 0;
        int[] buy = new int[prices.length];
        int[] sell = new int[prices.length];
        buy[0] = -prices[0];
        for (int i=1; i<prices.length; i++) {
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1]-prices[i]);
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1]+prices[i]);
        }
        return sell[sell.length-1];
    }
```

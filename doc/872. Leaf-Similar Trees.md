## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a *leaf value sequence.*

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.
Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

---
1. BFS to get the leaves : should I wrote two BFS to compare them? a bit stupid.
2. BFS cannot gaurantee the leaves order.
3. DFS, by search left first, and pass the queue to them. might be correct.


```java
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> l1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> l2 = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(root1, l1);
        helper(root2, l2);
        return Arrays.toString(l1.toArray()).equals(Arrays.toString(l2.toArray()));
    }
    public void helper(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) return;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            leaves.add(root.val);
            return;
        }
        helper(root.left, leaves);
        helper(root.right, leaves);
    }

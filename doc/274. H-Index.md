## 274. H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:** If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

---

1. there is no order, so search the array from begining to end. try to count every elements that small then current value and large than current value's citation.
2. that is O(N^2)
3. sort array, then binary search it. - lead to 275
4. [SOLUTION] bucket sort -> put every citations to bucket, if the citation is larger then `n`, add to `n`. then count back from `n, n-1 â€¦ 1, 0` if the count larger then i, that is h-index. which at least that many paper have citation larger then `i`.

```java
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] buckets = new int[n+1];
        for (int c : citations) {
            if (c >= n) buckets[n]++;
            else buckets[c]++;
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i=n; n>=0; i--) {
            cnt += buckets[i];
            if (cnt >= i) return i;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

## 812. Largest Triangle Area

You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

```
Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

1. cannot figure it out.
2. fuck bad problem.
3. brute force all 3 points to find out the most area.
4. the next point is how to calculate triangle area with 3 points?

For this case:

We can calculate the area as follow:

```java
    public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points) {
        double max = 0.0;
        for (int[] i : points) {
            for (int[] j : points) {
                for (int[] k : points) {
                    max = Math.max(max, 0.5 * Math.abs(i[0]*j[1] + j[0]*k[1] + k[0]*i[1] - j[0]*i[1] - k[0]*j[1] - i[0]*k[1]));
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
```

## 370. Range Addition

Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:
```
Input: length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]
Output: [-2,0,3,5,3]
```
Explanation:
```
Initial state:
[0,0,0,0,0]

After applying operation [1,3,2]:
[0,2,2,2,0]

After applying operation [2,4,3]:
[0,2,5,5,3]

After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
[-2,0,3,5,3]
```

1. should we consider the range out of bound? - assume NO
2. naive : for each input, calculate the sum. O(N^2)
3. better naive: count the sum of each position by sorting input array of first -> O(N*K)

```java
    public int[] getModifiedArray(int length, int[][] updates) {
        int[] res = new int[length];
        for (int i=0; i<length; i++) {
            for (int[] up : updates) {
                if (i>=up[0]&&i<=up[1]) res[i] += up[2];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

4. better solution: O(N+K): store inc value to the start index, and store negative inc value to the end index+1. the final result can be calculated, for each `i` postion, the result is sum(0, i-1). One entry example : `5, [1, 3, 2] > [0,2,0,0,-2] -> [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]`

## 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a **full binary tree**, but some nodes are null. 

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the `null` nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

----

1. BFS, add child even this child is null, and trim the null to count max length. - dead end.
2. [SOLUTION]

The idea is to use heap indexing:

```
        1
   2         3
 4   5     6   7
8 9 x 11  x 13 x 15
```
Regardless whether these nodes exist:

- Always make the id of left child as `parent_id * 2`;
- Always make the id of right child as `parent_id * 2 + 1`;

So we can just:

1. Record the `id` of `left most node` when first time at each level of the tree during an pre-order run.(you can tell by check the size of the container to hold the first nodes);
2. At each node, compare the `distance` from it the left most node with the current `max width`;:

```java
    public int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> leftestIdx = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return helper(root, leftestIdx, 1, 0);
    }
    public int helper(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leftestIdx, int index, int depth) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (depth==leftestIdx.size()) leftestIdx.add(index);
        int currDiff = index - leftestIdx.get(depth) + 1;
        int lcDiff = helper(root.left, leftestIdx, index*2, depth+1);
        int rcDiff = helper(root.right, leftestIdx, index*2+1, depth+1);
        return Math.max(currDiff, Math.max(lcDiff, rcDiff));
        
    }
```

## 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings

You want to build a house on an *empty* land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values **0**, **1** or **2**, where:

- Each **0** marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
- Each **1** marks a building which you cannot pass through.
- Each **2** marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
```

1. for each `0` point, using BFS to calculate sum of distance, and maintain the smallest O(N^2)
2. it failed because it cannot detect the building (1) reachability

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(int[][] grid) {
        int distance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int build = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j]==1) build++;
            }
        }
        for (int i=0; i<grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    int res = bfs(grid, i, j, build);
                    distance = Math.min(distance, res);
                }
            }
        }
        return distance==Integer.MAX_VALUE? -1 : distance;
    }
    public int bfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y, int b) {
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        Queue<Integer[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new Integer[]{x, y});
        int lv = 0;
        int dist = 0;
        int buildings = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int n = q.size();
            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                Integer[] curr = q.poll();
                if (curr[0]<0||curr[0]>=grid.length||curr[1]<0||curr[1]>=grid[0].length) continue;
                if (visited[curr[0]][curr[1]]) continue;
                if (grid[curr[0]][curr[1]] == 2) continue;
                visited[curr[0]][curr[1]] = true;
                if (grid[curr[0]][curr[1]] == 1) {
                    dist+=lv;
                    buildings++;
                    continue;
                }
                q.offer(new Integer[]{curr[0]-1, curr[1]});
                q.offer(new Integer[]{curr[0]+1, curr[1]});
                q.offer(new Integer[]{curr[0], curr[1]+1});
                q.offer(new Integer[]{curr[0], curr[1]-1});
            }
            lv++;
        }
        return dist==0 || buildings!=b ? Integer.MAX_VALUE: dist;
    }
}
```

It works but very slow

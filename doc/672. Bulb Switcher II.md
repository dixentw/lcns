## 672. Bulb Switcher II

There is a room with `n` lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly `m` unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the `n` lights could be.

Suppose `n` lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:

1. Flip all the lights.
2. Flip lights with even numbers.
3. Flip lights with odd numbers.
4. Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...



**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, m = 1.
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, m = 1.
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, m = 1.
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
```

1. how about m > 1?  -> how about m>4 => it will be mod 4, there are only 1, 2, 3, 4
2. if you have to do 4 operations, actually it will come to (3K+1) flip.
3. do 1+2=3, 1+3=2, 2+3=1
4. m == 0, return 1
5. n == 1 return 2
6. n==2, m==1, return 3
7. n==2, m>=2 return 4
8. n>=3, m==1,2,3
9. more than that, there is only 8 possiblilty



```java
    public int flipLights(int n, int m) {
        if (m == 0) return 1;
        if (n==1) return 2;
        if (n==2 && m==1) return 3;
        if (n==2 && m>=2) return 4;
        if (m==1) return 4;
        if (m==2) return 7; //don't know why
        if (m>=3) return 8; // don't know why
        return 0;
    }
```

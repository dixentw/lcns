## 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

- `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
- `age[B] > age[A]`
- `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

---

1. the naive is two layer of loop. get each pair and check against the codition.
2. the 3rd condition is a bit redundant.
3. by sorting input array
   1. the request number is valid with C(N, 2) which N is the element that they started to be request.
4. but this is wrong and still need to scan latter element to decide how many connections

[SOLUTION]

1. get freq map
2. check each age, accumulate it. and don't count self.

```java
    public int numFriendRequests(int[] ages) {
        int[] as = new int[121];
        for (int a : ages) as[a]++;
        // accumulate the request number to get all possible request
        for (int i=1; i<=120; i++) as[i] += as[i-1];
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int age : ages) {
            res += Math.max(0, as[age] - as[(age/2)+7]-1);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

1. the hint is about corelation with value and index.

2. if every number is show up, then `num[i-1] = i, i start with 1`

3. so we can mark the position by changing it to negative, after running the whole array. we identify all postive value and get the result.

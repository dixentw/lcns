## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

We have a list of `points` on the plane.  Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

1. calculate the point's distance
2. using min heap to store the k closest points

```java
    class Point {
        int[] p;
        double distance;
        public Point(int[] a, double dis) {
            this.p = a;
            this.distance = dis;
        }
    }
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        List<Point> ps = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=0; i<points.length; i++) {
            double a = Math.pow(points[i][0], 2) + Math.pow(points[i][1], 2);
            ps.add(new Point(points[i], Math.sqrt(a)));
        }
        PriorityQueue<Point> p = new PriorityQueue<Point>((a,b)-> Double.compare(b.distance, a.distance));
        for (int i=0; i<points.length; i++) {
            p.offer(ps.get(i));
            if (p.size() > K) {
                p.poll();
            }
        }
        int[][] res = new int[K][2];
        int i=0;
        while (!p.isEmpty()) {
            Point tmp = p.poll();
            res[i][0] = tmp.p[0];
            res[i][1] = tmp.p[1];
            i++;
        }
        return res;   
    }
```

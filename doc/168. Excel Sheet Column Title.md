## 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

For example:

```
    1 -> A
    2 -> B
    3 -> C
    ...
    26 -> Z
    27 -> AA
    28 -> AB 
    ...
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "A"
```

---

1. divide 26, will get the how many characters, write a while, divided with 26, and the use 'A' as 0 base.
2. the working version is directly minus one, makes it more easy to handle the index change.
3. note: working version is calculate from right to left. not what i original think from left to right.



```java
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (n > 0) {
            n--;
            sb.insert(0, (char)('A' + n%26));
            n /= 26;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    public String convertToTitleFAIL(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (n > 0) {
            n = n / 26;
            int m = n % 26;
            if (n == 0) {
                sb.append((char)('A' + m-1));
            } else {
                sb.append((char)('A' + n-1));
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
```

## 204. Count Primes

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, **n**.

**Example:**

```
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

1. for each number, decide it is prime number -> loop from 1 to helf of `i` then find if there is any number and devide it.
2. O(N^2)
3. basically the method is OK, but fail to write it.
4. reverse accumulate prime is good way. [SOLUTION]

```java
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        boolean[] noPrimes = new boolean[n];
        for (int i=2; i<n; i++) {
            if (!noPrimes[i]) {
                res++;
                for (int j=2; i*j<n; j++) {
                    noPrimes[i*j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes

Given an integer *n*, return the number of trailing zeroes in *n*!.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

1. how to generate `0`? - `2` and `5`
2. and `2` is always out numbers `5`, which means we only need to count 5's count.
3. naive implementation is too slow.
4. the formula is basically `n/5 + n/25 + n/(5^3)...` didn't implement it very good.
5. here are two implementations...

```java
    public int trailingZeroesRev(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        return n / 5 + trailingZeroes(n/5);
    }

    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            cnt += n/5;
            n/=5;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
```

## 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

Let's call an array `A` a *mountain* if the following properties hold:

- `A.length >= 3`
- There exists some `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any `i` such that `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
3. A is a mountain, as defined above.

1. binary search at the first sight.
2. when we got the mid, we check the mid is larger than both
   1. if left is larger then right, then we go left
   2. right as well
3. the terminal condition? traditional termination => end == start



```java
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] A) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = A.length-1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) /2;
            if (A[mid-1] < A[mid] && A[mid+1] < A[mid]) {
                return mid;
            } else if (A[mid-1] < A[mid]) { // can relax the condition, guarenteed by mountain array.
                start = mid+1;
            } else {
                end = mid-1;
            }
        }
        //suppose not come to here
        return -1;
    }
```

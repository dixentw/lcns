## 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
```

1. using a stack to store a list. or we can use recursion 
2. this problem provide the iterator interface, so implement with stack probabily good.
3. how to init with zero length list?
   1. [SOLUTION] put whole list into stack (with reverse order of list) that the stack is in correct order.
4. easy to come out of sulution. but failed to come out of method to.

```java
public class NestedIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    private Stack<NestedInteger> stack;
    public NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i=nestedList.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
            stack.push(nestedList.get(i));
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Integer next() {
        return stack.pop().getInteger();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            NestedInteger ni = stack.peek();
            if (!ni.isInteger()) {
                List<NestedInteger> l = stack.pop().getList();
                for (int i=l.size()-1; i>=0; i--) stack.push(l.get(i));
            } else {
                return true;
            } 
        }
      
```

### revise

1. all magic happened on hasNext()
2. everytime the test code will call hasNext and next.
3. in hasNext, it is ok to unpack nestedInteger once. but consider the empty nestedinteger, we need to unpack following nestedInteger. so there is a while loop in it.

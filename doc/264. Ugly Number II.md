## 264. Ugly Number II

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Note:**  

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. `n` **does not exceed 1690**.

---

1. make a series of number that only consist of 1, 2, 3, 5
2. so, it is base on number `(2^X) * (3^Y) *(5^Z)`
3. the problem become how to find the rule to know how to add X or Y or Z's count
4. [SOLUTION] - we still need to generated sequences, with calculated product to decide the next number.

the map goes like this:

```
(1) 1×2, 2×2, 3×2, 4×2, 5×2, …
(2) 1×3, 2×3, 3×3, 4×3, 5×3,…
(3) 1×5, 2×5, 3×5, 4×5, 5×5, …
```

everytime we can see the ugly series multiply factor2, or 3, or 5, just use the smallest to generate next one.

```java
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] ugly = new int[n+1];
        int index2 = 1;
        int index3 = 1;
        int index5 = 1;
        int factor2 = 2;
        int factor3 = 3;
        int factor5 = 5;
        ugly[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            ugly[i] = Math.min(factor2, Math.min(factor3, factor5));
            if (ugly[i] == factor2) {
                factor2 = 2 * ugly[++index2];
            }
            if (ugly[i] == factor3) {
                factor3 = 3 * ugly[++index3];
            }
            if (ugly[i] == factor5) {
                factor5 = 5 * ugly[++index5];
            }

        }
        return ugly[n];
    }
```

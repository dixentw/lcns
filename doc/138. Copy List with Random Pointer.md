## 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

---

1. copy list node, but move pointer with next pointer. (O(N))
2. fill random pointer for new lost (O(N))

```java
    // failed one.
    public RandomListNode copyRandomList(RandomListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        RandomListNode res = new RandomListNode(head.label);
        RandomListNode curr = head;
        RandomListNode cloneIdx = res;
        // by this assigment, need to return res.next (using res as dummy)
        while (curr != null) {
            cloneIdx = new RandomListNode(curr.label);
            curr = curr.next;
            cloneIdx = cloneIdx.next;
        }        
        curr = head;
        cloneIdx = res;
        while (curr != null) {
            cloneIdx.random = curr.random; // this assignment is wrong, the random pointer didn't get copied, it point to original list.
            curr = curr.next;
            cloneIdx = cloneIdx.next;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

So, the correct implementation of this clone would become O(N^2) (we need to traverse every node in  cloned list, to find the node that random pointer point.)

[From Answer] - using hashmap to store the new nodes, space will become O(N), the time will back to O(N)

```java
    public RandomListNode copyRandomList(RandomListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        RandomListNode curr = head;
        Map<RandomListNode, RandomListNode> cloned = new HashMap<>();
        while (curr != null) {
            cloned.put(curr, new RandomListNode(curr.label));
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            cloned.get(curr).next = cloned.get(curr.next);
            cloned.get(curr).random = cloned.get(curr.random);
            curr = curr.next;
        }
      
```

[From Answer] - 

1. insert copied node right after current node,
2. **curr.next.random = curr.random.next;** - should check nullity and the next current node.
3. separate the copied list with original list - tricky

```java
    public RandomListNode copyRandomList(RandomListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        RandomListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            RandomListNode copy = new RandomListNode(curr.label);
            RandomListNode n = curr.next;
            curr.next = copy;
            copy.next = n;
            curr = n;
        }
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.random != null) {
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next; // curr.random's copy
            }
            curr = curr.next.next;// notice.
        }
        curr = head;
        RandomListNode res = head.next;
        RandomListNode itr = res;
        while (curr != null) {
            RandomListNode n = curr.next.next;
            RandomListNode copyNext = (n==null) ? null : n.next;
            curr.next = n;
            itr.next = copyNext;

            // move forward.
            itr = itr.next;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

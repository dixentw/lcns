## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
​        _______6______
​       /              \

1. given p and q two nodes, we check if p is located in left subtree and q locate in right subtree. if so, the current root is LCA
2. if p and q are both in left subtree, then we search left subtree.


```java
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        if (root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) return root;
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        if (left != null && right != null) return root;
        if (left != null) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        if (right != null) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return null;
    }
```

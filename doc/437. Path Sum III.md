## 437. Path Sum III

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

>Example:
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8
 ​     10
 ​    /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1
Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11

1. this is hard because this is partial. The path should always keep the latest node, but how to remove from previous? ex: 10>5>3 how can I only get 5 and 3 ?
2. implementing start and end pointer to the 

[SOLUTION]
1. easy one :
   1. recursive - I cannot come out the larger recursion contains smaller recursion.
   2. This is top down method. we find the root to leaf first, then recursively called down to all of it's subtree. O(N^2)

```java
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return helper(root, sum) + pathSum(root.left, sum) + pathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
    public int helper(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int curr = (sum == node.val) ? 1 : 0
        return curr + helper(node.left, sum-node.val) + helper(node.right, sum-node.val);
    }
```

1. this is more like my original thought, but it actually use concept of preSum in #560, should check it again

```java
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> preSum = new HashMap<>();
        preSum.put(0, 1);
        return helperPreSum(root, 0, sum, preSum);
    }

    public int helperPreSum(TreeNode node, int currSum, int target, Map<Integer,Integer> preSum) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        currSum += node.val;
        int res = preSum.getOrDefault(currSum - target, 0);
        preSum.put(currSum, preSum.getOrDefault(currSum, 0) + 1); // save current sum to this map
        res += helperPreSum(node.left, currSum, target, preSum) + helperPreSum(node.right, currSum, target, preSum);
        // remove current, since we going back.
        preSum.put(currSum, preSum.get(currSum) - 1); //remove current sum to map since we only have one map. like backtracing.
        return res;
    }
```

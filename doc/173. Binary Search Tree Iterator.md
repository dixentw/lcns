## 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.

1. kind of don't get the idea of this traversal. After looking the solution. It seems that iterator with this binary tree with inorder traversal
2. so this question is about combine iterative binary tree traversal with iterator API

```java
public class BSTIterator {
    private Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<TreeNode>();

    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            stack.push(curr);
            curr = curr.left;
        }
    }

    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !stack.empty();
    }

    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        TreeNode tmp = stack.pop();
        int res = tmp.val;
        if (tmp.right != null) {
            TreeNode curr = tmp.right;
            while (curr != null) {
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

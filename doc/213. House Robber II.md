## 213. House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

* it seems the modification of house robber 1, that if arr[1] > arr[0], then use f[len-1] as result, or arr[0] < arr[1], use f[len-1]  , if equals, return max(f[len-1], f[len-2]) 
  * this solution is wrong when compare it with first and second house.
  * the more proper way to do it is we need to calculate two conditions. and give the best solution
  * which leads to code : calculate rob1 condition, and calculate rob2 condition

```java
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length==0) return 0;
        if (nums.length==1) return nums[0];
        int[] f = new int[nums.length];
        f[0] = nums[0];
        f[1] = Math.max(nums[1], f[0]);
        for (int i=2; i<nums.length; i++) {
            f[i] = Math.max(f[i-2]+nums[i], f[i-1]);
        }
        // rob first
        int sol1 = f[nums.length-2];
        // not rob first
        f[0] = 0;
        f[1] = nums[1];
        for (int i=2; i<nums.length; i++) {
            f[i] = Math.max(f[i-2]+nums[i], f[i-1]);
        }
        int sol2 = f[nums.length-1];
        return Math.max(sol1, sol2);
    }
}
```

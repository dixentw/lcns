## 127. Word Ladder

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

----

1. if end word is not shown in wordlist, then return 0

2. the word list transition is linked (cannot separate each characters with their possiblity.)

3. the proper way to iterate is still using possible characters and check new word in wordList.

4. it is BFS search.

```java
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(beginWord);
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(beginWord);

        Set<String> wl = new HashSet<>(wordList);

        int res = 1;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int n = q.size();
            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                String curr = q.poll();
                for (int j=0; j<curr.length(); j++) {
                    char[] tmp = curr.toCharArray();
                    for (char a='a'; a<='z'; a++) {
                        tmp[j] = a;
                        String child = new String(tmp);
                        if (!visited.contains(child) && wl.contains(child)) {
                            if (child.equals(endWord)) return res+1;
                            q.add(child);
                            visited.add(child);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            res++;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

## 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees

A *full binary tree* is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each tree in the answer **must** have `node.val = 0`.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]

1. for each node, either it has 2 childs, plus itself is three.
2. Might have some N that makes  no complete binary tree? such as 2?
3. [SOLUTION] if N is even, return empty list.
4. if N is odd, left is from 1,3,5,..., to N-2, right is N-i-1

```java
    public List<TreeNode> allPossibleFBT(int N) {
        List<TreeNode> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (N==1) {
            res.add(new TreeNode(0));
            return res;
        }
        if (N<1 || N%2==0) return res;
        for (int i=1; i<n; i+=2) {
            List<TreeNode> left = allPossibleFBT(i);
            List<TreeNode> right = allPossibleFBT(n-i-1);
            for (TreeNode l : left) {
                for (TreeNode r : right) {
                    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(0);
                    root.left = l;
                    root.right = r;
                    res.add(root);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

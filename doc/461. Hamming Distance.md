## 461. Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

----

1. loop througth bit by bit to compare.
2. the problem is if there is negative number, the most significant bit will be with shift.
3. exclusive or is important, original solution didn't consider the most significant bit. but it seems ok with OJ. maybe testing data don't have minus number.

```java
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int xor = x ^ y, count = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<32;i++) count += (xor >> i) & 1;
        return count;
    }
    public int _hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = 0;
        while (x!=0 || y!=0) {
            int a = x & 1;
            int b = y & 1;
            if (a != b) res++;
            x = x >>> 1;
            y = y >>> 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

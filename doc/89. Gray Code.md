## 89. Gray Code

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer *n* representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

1. recursivly get the code?
2. using backtracking 
   1. how to represent binary number? int array with all zero?
   2. what is terminal condition? all ones in array? - failed. some backtracking will happend from `101` -> `010`
   3. list of int array, append each bit into list -> failed to understand.
3. using divided and conqure
   1. for each list, if we need to append one more bit to left of original list, there is a treat:
      1. Orignal List `L1` :`{00, 01, 11, 10}`
      2. create reverse L1 : `{00, 01, 11, 10}, {10, 11, 01, 00}`
      3. append `0` to first part, append 1 to second part -> `{000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100}`

```java
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        res.add(0);
        if (n==0) return res;
        res.add(1);
        for (int i=2; i< (1<<n); i=i<<1) {
            for (int j=i-1; j>=0; j--) {
                res.add(res.get(j));
            }
            for (int j=i; j<res.size(); j++) {
                res.set(j, res.get(j)+i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

1. it feels like #50 reverse...
2. it actually simpler, because only need to return integer part.
3. [FAIL] integer overflow.

```java
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long in = x;
        long i = 1;
        while (i*i <= x) {
            i++;
        }
        return (int) i-1;
    }
```
